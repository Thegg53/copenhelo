# Copenhelo ELO Rating System

An automated ELO rating system for Magic: The Gathering tournaments. Parses tournament data, calculates ratings, and generates leaderboards.

## Setup

```bash
make install
```

This creates a Python virtual environment and installs dependencies.

## Running the Pipeline

After adding new players to `input/opt_in.csv` (or when you need to regenerate everything from scratch):

```bash
make reset
```

This is the **default command to use** when managing player consent. It performs a complete reset:
1. Parses all tournaments from `input/`
2. Recalculates ELO history from scratch
3. Generates fresh HTML outputs (leaderboard, players, tournaments)

As players slowly give consent, simply add them to `input/opt_in.csv` and run `make reset` to regenerate everything with the updated roster.

## Alternative: Final Standings Version

For a simpler pipeline that works with **final standings only** (no round-by-round data needed):

```bash
make final_standings_reset
```

See [final_standings_version/README.md](final_standings_version/README.md) for details. This extracts from EventLink HTML, calculates cumulative ELO ratings, and generates an interactive leaderboard.

## Data Structure

### Input Format

Tournament files go in `input/{YYYYMMDD}_{format}_{location}/` with round-by-round HTML files:

```
input/
└── 20260530_pauper_baltzer/
    ├── r1.htm
    ├── r2.htm
    ├── r3.htm
    └── r4.htm
```

Files are EventLink HTML export files with pairings tables.

## Opt-In System

Player data visibility is controlled via `input/opt_in.csv` which contains a list of player names who have consented to have their data displayed publicly.

### Configuration

Add player names to `input/opt_in.csv` (one per line):

```
Foo Bar
John Doe
Albert Einstein
```

### Privacy Features

- **Opted-in players:** Display full names and complete match history across all pages
- **Non-opted-in players:** Replaced with "Hidden Player" or "Hidden Opponent" in output
- **Two-level sanitization:**
  1. Internal: Use opponent's actual rating if opted-in, otherwise use default 1500
  2. Output: Replace non-opted-in player names in all JSON and HTML files before publishing

This ensures non-consenting players cannot be identified through rating inference or any other method.

## Pipeline

### Step 1: Parse Tournaments

```bash
make run-parse
```

**Script:** `scripts/parse_tournaments.py`

- Reads HTML files from `input/{tournament_id}/`
- Extracts match data (players, results, byes)
- Outputs:
  - `events/{tournament_id}.json` - Clean tournament data
  - `events/parsed_events.csv` - Log of parsed tournaments (prevents re-parsing)
- Logs detailed round-by-round match counts

**Idempotency:** Checks `parsed_events.csv` to skip already-parsed tournaments.

### Step 2: Calculate ELO Ratings

```bash
make run-elo
```

**Script:** `scripts/elo_calculator.py`

- Reads all `events/*.json` files
- Calculates ELO ratings (K=32, default=1500)
- Outputs:
  - `output/players.json` - Player ratings and match history
  - `output/tournaments.json` - Tournament metadata
- Logs every match with rating changes

**Idempotency:** Checks `output/tournaments.json` to skip already-calculated tournaments.

**ELO Formula:**
```
expected_score = 1 / (1 + 10^((opponent_rating - current_rating) / 400))
rating_change = K * (result - expected_score)
new_rating = current_rating + rating_change
```

### Step 3: Generate Pages

```bash
make run
```

Runs all five generators in sequence:

#### Leaderboard (`scripts/leaderboard_generator.py`)
- Outputs: `leaderboard.html`
- Sorted by rating (highest first)
- Links to player detail pages

#### Player Pages (`scripts/players_generator.py`)
- Outputs: `players.html`
- Collapsible player sections
- Full match history with tournament links
- Auto-expands player when navigated via hash anchor

#### Tournament Pages (`scripts/tournaments_generator.py`)
- Outputs: `tournaments.html`
- All tournaments in chronological order
- Match results by round
- Tournament names linked from player pages

## Full Pipeline

Run everything in sequence:

```bash
make run
```

Order: Parse → ELO Calculate → Generate Pages

This executes:
1. `parse_tournaments.py` - Extract tournament data
2. `elo_calculator.py` - Calculate ratings
3. `leaderboard_generator.py` - Generate leaderboard.html
4. `players_generator.py` - Generate players.html
5. `tournaments_generator.py` - Generate tournaments.html

## Recalculation

To clear all processed data and recalculate from scratch:

```bash
make recalculate
```

**Script:** `scripts/recalculate_history.py`

- Clears `events/parsed_events.csv`
- Clears `output/` directory
- Re-runs ELO calculation from all `events/*.json` files
- Useful if tournament dates need reordering

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite validates all core functionality:

```bash
make test
```

### Test Coverage

**34 tests** across 6 test files:

- **test_elo_calculator.py** (9 tests)
  - ELO rating calculations and formulas
  - Default ratings and K-factor handling
  - Win/loss/draw scenarios

- **test_parse_tournaments.py** (3 tests)
  - HTML parsing and data extraction
  - Tournament deduplication
  - Log buffering

- **test_leaderboard_generator.py** (6 tests)
  - URL slug generation
  - Player data loading and sorting
  - HTML output validation

- **test_players_generator.py** (5 tests)
  - Player page generation
  - Match history display
  - Opt-in privacy enforcement

- **test_tournaments_generator.py** (7 tests)
  - Tournament data parsing
  - Tournament page generation
  - Player visibility based on opt-in

- **test_privacy.py** (4 tests)
  - Opt-in filtering verification
  - Opponent name sanitization
  - Player name hiding in output
  - No non-opted-in names in JSON output

### Running Tests

```bash
make test                 # Run all tests
make test -v             # Verbose output
make test tests/test_elo_calculator.py  # Run specific test file
```

All tests pass and validate:
- Core ELO calculation accuracy
- HTML generation correctness
- Privacy system enforcement
- Data persistence and idempotency

## Logging

All scripts log to `log.txt` with timestamps. Logs are appended in chronological order.

Format: `[YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSSSS] message`

- **Parsing logs:** Round-by-round match counts
- **ELO logs:** Every match with result and rating changes
- **Generation logs:** Output file locations and counts

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The file `.github/workflows/update-elo.yml` automatically runs the pipeline daily.

### Trigger

- **Schedule:** Daily at 00:00 UTC (midnight)
- **Manual:** Via `workflow_dispatch` (can run from GitHub UI)

### Steps

1. **Checkout** - Clone the repository
2. **Setup Python** - Install Python 3.11
3. **Install dependencies** - Run `make install`
4. **Parse tournaments** - Run `make run-parse`
5. **Calculate ratings** - Run `make run-elo`
6. **Generate pages** - Run leaderboard, player, and tournament generators
7. **Commit and push** - Commits changes back to main branch
   - Only commits if files changed (checks with MD5)
   - Includes updated HTML pages and log.txt

### Deployment

After workflow completion:
- All generated HTML files are committed
- GitHub Pages serves the files automatically (if enabled)
- **leaderboard.html** - Main page (can be served as index)
- **players.html** - Player details
- **tournaments.html** - Tournament results

### To Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to repo Settings → Pages
2. Source: Select "main branch"
3. Pages will be available at `https://username.github.io/copenhelo/`

Or to serve from root:
1. Rename `leaderboard.html` to `index.html`
2. Update links in HTML files to match

## Commands Summary

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `make install` | Create virtual environment |
| `make run` | Run full pipeline (parse → elo → pages) |
| `make run-parse` | Parse tournaments only |
| `make run-elo` | Calculate ratings only |
| `make recalculate` | Clear data and recalculate everything |
| `make help` | Show available commands |

## Example Workflow

1. **Add tournament:** Place HTML files in `input/20260603_modern_cph/`
2. **Run pipeline:** `make run`
3. **Check logs:** `cat log.txt` to see parsed rounds and rating changes
4. **View results:** Open `leaderboard.html` in browser
5. **Explore:** Click player names to see history, tournament names to see results

## Notes

- All scripts use buffered logging with timestamps
- Idempotency prevents re-processing tournaments
- ELO calculations are executed in round order
- Players start at rating 1500 if new
- HTML files are overwritten on each generation (safe to delete)
- Data files (JSON, CSV) are never deleted (only appended)
